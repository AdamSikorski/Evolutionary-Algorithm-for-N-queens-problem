# Evolutionary-Algorithm-for-N-queens-problem

About the project
Its an implementation of evolutionary algorythm for N queens problem.

Technologies
Project is written fully in python. Code is stored in google colab notebook.
You can preview the code with its output just by clicking on it on github.
I've also added a raw python version.

Setup
Code of the project is stored in Evolutionary_Algorithm.ipynb and also in evolutionary_algorithm [raw python].py

You can run the project in 2 ways:

1) Evolutionary_Algorithm.ipynb - Click on the Evolutionary_Algorithm.ipynb file and then on "Open in Colab". That will open the colab notebook where you can run the code.
2) evolutionary_algorithm [raw python].py - open the code in any Python IDEs and Code Editors and simply run it.
